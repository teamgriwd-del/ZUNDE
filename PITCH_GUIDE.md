# PFUMA — Booth Pitch Guide
### For explaining PFUMA to a crowd at the Zimbabwe Agricultural Show 2026

This is not a technical document — it's a script and a set of talking points for standing at the stand and actually selling the idea to whoever walks up, in the thirty seconds you have before they decide whether to keep listening. Read it once before the show, then keep it nearby as a cheat sheet. For the technical deep-dive, use `PFUMA_Poster.pdf`; for the plain-language handout, use `PFUMA_Poster_Public.pdf`; for the legal/impact case, use `IMPACT_AND_COMPLIANCE.md`. This doc is for your *voice*, not for handing out.

## 1. The 10-second hook (say this first, always)

> "*Pfuma* is the Shona word for wealth — and for a rural family, that wealth is usually standing in the kraal. We built an app that protects it: stops your cattle being stolen, catches disease before it spreads, and gets police and vets involved digitally instead of on foot."

Then stop talking. Let them ask a question. Whatever they ask, it leads into one of the sections below.

## 2. The problem, in one breath

Don't lecture — pick ONE of these depending on who's in front of you, and say it like a fact, not a pitch:

- **To a farmer:** "How do you prove a cow is really yours if someone disputes it, or if it's stolen and you need to report it fast?"
- **To anyone:** "January Disease alone has killed over 500,000 cattle in Zimbabwe since 2016 — most of that is preventable if it's caught early."
- **To a skeptic:** "Right now, livestock theft, ownership disputes, and disease outbreaks are tracked on paper, by memory, or not at all. Police can't clear a sale they have no visibility into."

Real number worth memorizing: a single ZRP crackdown led to **over 3,400 arrests** for stock theft. This is not a small problem people are exaggerating for a pitch — it's a documented national one.

## 3. What PFUMA actually is (the 30-second version)

> "PFUMA is one platform with five kinds of accounts — Farmer, Veterinarian, Supplier, Retailer, and Police — that all plug into the same livestock record. A farmer registers an animal, a vet can certify its health, a police officer has to clear it before it's sold, and a buyer can see all of that before they hand over money. It's the paper trail everyone already *should* have, except it's real, it's digital, and nobody can fake it after the fact."

If they want more: it also has an AI assistant (Jinda) that answers farming/legal questions in plain language, and real IoT hardware — a smart collar that reports an animal's temperature, heart rate, and location, and raises an alert if it leaves the farm or spikes a fever.

---

## 4. "Who are you?" — branch the conversation by role

Ask them what they do, or guess from context, then use the matching pitch:

### 🌾 If they're a farmer
> "You register your animals once — breed, tag, brand, health record. After that, PFUMA tracks weight, vaccination due-dates, and health for you. If you ever want to sell, you list it on the Marketplace, and because it's already tied to your verified profile, buyers trust it more and police clear it faster. And if you get the hardware collar, you get an alert on your phone the moment an animal leaves the farm boundary or its temperature spikes — before you'd ever notice on your own."

### 🩺 If they're a vet
> "You get a caseload dashboard by province and district — real disease surveillance data, not guesswork. Farmers message you directly through the app for consultations, and when you certify an animal's health or issue a movement permit, that becomes part of the animal's permanent record. It's fewer wasted trips and better outbreak visibility."

### 🚚 If they're a supplier (medicine, feed, vaccines)
> "Farmers see your stock and order through the app instead of a phone call and a guess. You get a direct channel to exactly the farmers who need what you sell, in their district."

### 🏪 If they're a retailer / buyer
> "Every animal on the Marketplace has been through police clearance and often a vet certificate before it's even listed. You're not buying a stranger's word for it — you're buying a record."

### 👮 If they're police, or you're pitching the law-enforcement angle
> "Right now a listing can't go live until an officer verifies ownership and brand papers and issues a movement permit — that's built into the software, not a suggestion. It mirrors exactly what the Stock Theft Prevention Act already requires; we just made it impossible to skip the step."

---

## 5. How it all fits together (use this if they ask "so how does it connect?")

Walk it as a story, not a diagram:

> "Say a farmer's cow gets sick. He messages a vet through the app, the vet reviews it and maybe orders medicine from a supplier — that's three roles talking through one system. Later he wants to sell that same cow. He lists it, but it doesn't go live yet — an officer has to verify the papers and clear it first. Only then can a retailer see it, bid, and buy it, and the vet's health record and the police clearance both travel with that sale. Every step is the same one animal's file, growing over time."

---

## 6. The hardware, in one sentence

> "We didn't just build software — we designed real collar hardware: ESP32 microcontroller, GPS, heart-rate and temperature sensors, talking to a base station over long-range radio, so this works on a farm with no WiFi and no cell signal near the cattle."

If they push for detail: mention it reports temperature, heart rate, movement, and location, and flags fever or a geofence breach automatically — and that the wiring diagrams, BOM, and firmware are real and buildable, not a mockup. Show `hardware/actual_equipment/` photos if you have a laptop handy.

---

## 7. Common questions and how to answer them (don't dodge these — they're good questions)

**"What if a farmer doesn't have a smartphone?"**
> "That's a real gap for version one — right now it needs a phone or the web app. It's the same gap every digital agriculture tool has to solve, and it's on our roadmap, not something we're pretending isn't a limitation."

**"Isn't this just another app that'll be abandoned in a year?"**
> "The difference is we built the boring, unglamorous part first — real authentication, real database, real legal research into the actual Acts this maps to. Most projects at this stage are a UI mockup. Ours has a working backend, a working database, and hardware you could actually order parts for today."

**"How is this different from just calling the vet or the police directly?"**
> "You still call them — PFUMA doesn't replace that relationship, it gives it a paper trail. A phone call disappears. A record in PFUMA doesn't."

**"Who verifies the police accounts, so a fake officer can't just approve fake sales?"**
> "Police accounts aren't self-signup — an existing verified officer has to create and vouch for the next one, the same way real ZRP units onboard new members. There's no way to just register as a police officer off the street."

**"Is this legal / does it actually match Zimbabwean law?"**
> "Yes — every major feature is mapped to a specific Act: the Stock Theft Prevention Act, the Animal Health Act, the Veterinary Surgeons Act, the Livestock Identification framework, the Consumer Protection Act. It's documented, cited, and in the `compliance/` folder if anyone wants to check it themselves."

## 8. Closing the conversation — the call to action

Don't let them walk away with just words. Get them to *do* something:

> "Want to see it live? I can register you a demo account right now — takes thirty seconds, and you can look around as whichever role you want, even Police."

(Use the demo copy of PFUMA for this — dummy signups are instantly usable, no waiting on review, exactly so you can do this on the spot.)

If they're a farmer/vet/supplier genuinely interested beyond the demo: take their contact and note it down — a follow-up after the show is worth more than a booth conversation they forget by the next stall.

---

## 9. If you only remember five things

1. **Pfuma = wealth (Shona)** — and this protects it.
2. **Five roles, one shared record** — Farmer, Vet, Supplier, Retailer, Police.
3. **A sale can't go live until police clear it** — that's the headline feature.
4. **Real numbers**: 500,000+ cattle lost to January Disease since 2016; 3,400+ arrests in one stock-theft crackdown.
5. **It's real** — working backend, working database, real hardware design, researched legal compliance. Not a mockup.
